# Copy this file to each test directory and update with your PBS server details.
# This file should NOT be committed to version control (add to .gitignore).
#
# Alternatively, set these as environment variables with TF_VAR_ prefix:
#   export TF_VAR_pbs_endpoint="https://192.168.1.108:8007"
#   export TF_VAR_pbs_username="root@pam"
#   export TF_VAR_pbs_password="your-password"

pbs_endpoint = "https://192.168.1.108:8007"
pbs_username = "root@pam"
pbs_password = "your-password"
